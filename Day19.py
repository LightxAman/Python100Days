# Do-While loop in python
# doâ€¦while is a loo[ in which a set of instructions will execute at least once(irrespective of the conditions)
# and then the repetition of loo['s body  will depend on the condition passed at the end of the while loop.
# It is also known as an exit-control loop

# How to emulate do...While loop in python?
# TO create a do while loop in python, you need to modify the while loop a bit in order to get similar behavior to a
# do while loop

# The most common technique to emulate a do-while loop in python is to use an infinite while loop with a break statement
# wrapped in an if statement that checks a given condition and breaks the iteration if that condition becomes true

print("Example 1: ")

while True:
    number = int(input("Enter a positive number less than 10: "))
    print(number)
    if not number > 10:
        break

print("\nExample 2: ")

secret_word = "python"
counter = 0

while True:
    word = input("Enter the secret word: ").lower()
    counter = counter + 1
    if word == secret_word:
        break
    if word != secret_word and counter > 7:
        break
