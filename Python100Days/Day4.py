# Title : Comments, Escape character sequences and print statement

# This print statement will throw an error because we entered a new line

# print("Hey , I am a good boy,
#       and you are a good boy too")

#  to resolve this use "escape sequence characters eg \n"

print("Hey , I am a good boy\nand you are a good boy too")

# This introduces a new line

# This is a single line comment
print("Hello World")  # A comment can be added after the statements as well

# A multiline comment can also be done by using """ """ or ''' '''

Yo this is all a multiline comment example
never mind the text written 
a lot of my mind is 
chipi chipi chapa chapa 
dubi dubi daba daba
